In this project, I implemented some algorithms for scheduling tasks.

## Structure

not yet.

## Algorithms

- [x] Rate Monothonic
- [x] Deadline Monotonic
- [x] Earliest Deadline First
- [] Least Laxity First : code is not working :/

PS: I wasn't able to implement LLF for now. I will try to fix it later.
